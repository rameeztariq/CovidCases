# CovidCases

This project is created for the sake of POC.

The project was created on .net core

I have used repository pattern for this project.

I have used https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc APIs to retrieve the data for the covid.

The APIs require an authorization mechanism. I have used jwt for authorizing the user.

# Consumed Covid APIs

I have used RestSharp for fetching the data from the covid cases APIs.

# Database 

Please run the migration in order to create the database.
